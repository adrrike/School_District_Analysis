# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
### Purpose: 
Maria and her supervisor said that the previous file showed evidence of academic dishonesty. We have been asked to replace the 9th grade Thomas High School math and reading scores with Nan's in the data and to re-run the analysis. 

### Results:

How is the district summary affected?
- Overall Passing Percentage: went down .2%
- Passing Math % and Passing Reading % both went down by approximately .1%

How is the school summary affected?
At Thomas High School the following changes occurred as a result of removing all 9th grade math and reading scores:
- % Passing Math up 26%
- % Passing Reading up 27%
- % Overall Passing up 25%

How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
Performance increases dramatically, almost concerningly so. I would recommend further analysis into the removed 9th grade scores. 
Thomas High School went from one of the worst performing high schools to one of the highest performing high schools. 

How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
